This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## EduNexus AI
EduNexus AI, a transformation from a simple EdTech to AI powered EdTech, that can be used by schools worldwide.
A LMS(Learning Management System) system with EIMS(Education Institution Management System) our data storing system for further
improvements in our own system, could even be used by research institutes or government for making better policies.
AI Cousnellor, for students for talking about their day-to-day problems.
(anonymity of student data is made sure for most conversations with our AI.)

For counsellor we have fine-tune llama-3-8B on https://www.youdata.ai/datasets/661d14096afcd643cb80668f,
also we have used llama-guard-2-8B for user question filter.
**Response from AI is slow cause models are running on hf-cpu.

Python api code: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Arpit-Bansal/llama_3_8B-counsellor_v0.5/tree/main
counsellor can be separately accessed via: https://arpit-bansal-llama-3-8b-counsellor-v0-5.hf.space/docs#
our model used as counsellor: https://huggingface.co/Arpit-Bansal/counsellor_model_q5_k_m
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
